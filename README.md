- Prompts the user for their name.
- Allows the user to select one of five Washington Commanders players.
- Displays available statistics for that player.
- Lets the user select a specific stat to view.
- Asks a trivia question about the chosen player.
- Supports repeated use without restarting the program.

## Python Concepts Included (Per Project Proposal)

1. **Functions and Parameters** – Used to organize logic into reusable blocks.
2. **Lists and Dictionaries** – Store and manage player data and available stats.
3. **Conditionals and Loops** – Control user flow, input handling, and decision logic.
4. **Error Handling** – Validates inputs to prevent crashes and guide user choices.
5. **Testing** – A separate test file verifies key functionality in the program.
