# NFL Performance Tracker – Commanders 2024 Stats

This project is a Python-based NFL performance tracker that lets users explore 2024 stats for five Washington Commanders players. Users can view stats, answer trivia questions, and interactively explore data using loops, classes, conditionals, and other Python fundamentals.

- Shows 2024 stats like touchdowns, rushing yards, receptions, and passing yards.
- Includes interactive trivia about the selected player.
- Uses input validation and loops to ensure smooth interaction.

## ✅ Requirements From Approved Project Proposal

1. **Functions and Parameters** – Used to prompt users, show stats, handle trivia.
2. **Lists and Dictionaries** – Player stats stored in nested dictionaries.
3. **Conditionals and Loops** – Control flow for input checking and navigation.
4. **Error Handling** – Invalid inputs (player names, stats) are handled cleanly.
5. **Testing** – Includes a separate test file to validate main script functions.
